## Story Description
In Boxman, you play as one of the last remaining protectors of the galaxy tasked to defeat various evil foes controlled by a diabolical Diamond that threatens all life in the universe. There are many mysteries to uncover in the universe of Boxman. From rips seemingly forming within the fabric of space, to uncovering to true origin of ancient powerful beings!

The gameplay involves the player traversing through a 2D side scroller then when completing the level in that perspective the camera will switch to a top-down perspective where the player continues to face new challenges!

## Game Mechanics
### **_Camera Perspective_**
Each section of the game (at least 2) where player will begin in a side scrolling action game perspective then when moving to next section camera will switch to top-down perspective where player will accomplish their goals.

### **_Combat System and Player Movement_**

Become **_Boxman_**, the legendary defender of a galaxy under siege!
You can _leap_ and _sprint_ through an **immersive planetary** environment. 

Claim your inner interplanetary knight as you slice your way through our side-scroller gameplay and challenge yourself to reach new heights in the overhead view. 

Channel your power to slice and stab villains, like spitters, seekers, and barricades. Nothing can stand in your way. Act quickly to dodge their projectile attacks!

### _Dark Mode_
* **Purpose**: The purpose of dark mode is to grant Boxman a noticeable buff to his strength.

* **Functionality**: Dark mode is activated when Boxman is in need of a hand. After activation, the ability stays active for a duration of nine seconds, followed by a cooldown period of 30 seconds. 

* **Abilities**: During dark mode, Boxman is granted a noticeable boost to his sword damage and agility (20% damage boost and 10% boost to movement speed).

* **Narrative**: Dark mode is a reflection of Boxman’s inner pain and grief. As his physical and mental health diminishes, he is able to harness that pain to grant him special dark powers.

Similar to light mode, Boxman is able to activate dark mode due to possessing the DNA of an ancient being known as Vega.

## Planned Mechanics

### Upgrade system
* **Purpose**: Unlocked abilities are specific powers that are granted to Boxman throughout the story. 
* **Functionality**: Once an unlocked ability is earned, it is added to a menu which displays all of Boxman’s current abilities. Most unlocked abilities will always be activated and won’t require the use of energy; for example, double jump and permanent stat improvements. 

### Light Mode
* **Purpose**: Light mode is intended to serve as a significant buff to Boxman’s vitality and strength for a short time. 
* **Functionality**: Light mode is achieved by defeating enough enemies to fill an energy bar beneath the health bar. Once the energy bar is filled, the player must press a certain key to activate the mode. Once the mode is activated, it will continue for at least 10-15 seconds or until the player exhausts the energy bar by doing special attacks.

* **Abilities**: Light mode grants the player a significant boost to their health and damage, enough to tank at least 5-8 more attacks than usual and one hit most enemies. The player also gains access to special attacks during this mode, such as a charged sword swing. 

* **Narrative**: Light mode is a reflection of Boxman’s inner confidence; the more successful he is during battle, the further his confidence grows which allows him to achieve greater heights of power. Light mode was granted to Boxman through Prophet's genetic modifications, borrowing DNA from an ancient deceased being known as Sirius.

### Episodes III and IV

#### **Purpose**
The continuation of Boxman’s journey and abilities, as he approaches the anomaly and the final conclusion of his work saving the galaxy one box-citizen at a time.

#### **New Characters**

#### **Settings**
Check out interesting new biomes such as the iconic desert planet of Barren IV, the earthlike biospheres and greenery of Arcadia I, and the rainy, lonely planet of Sorrow VI.
