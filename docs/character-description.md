## Boxman

### Abilities
- Classic:
    - Charge-up attack:
        - Let go attack, wave-slash or sword-slash
        - White-bar in concept art
    - Glowing (hold button) and let go of button, electric sword attack(?)
- Dark:
    - Button to press
    - Slower and cannot jump as high but more powerful attack (larger swing of sword)
    - User Testing
        - Scenario:
            - Under a timer: use for 20-30 seconds (test with 15)
            - Cool-down: 30 seconds?
        - Current concept: no wait-time
        - Half-way through health
            - Press key to go to dark-mode
    - Questions:
        - Do we make it so we should only use it when at half-health??
        - Might this be too OP?
- Suggested Enemy Encounters in Dark Mode:
    - Barricades: slightly difficult to kill?
    - Turrets: once indestructible, but can destroy them
